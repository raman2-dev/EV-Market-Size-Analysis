# EV Market Size Analysis

Electric Vehicles Market Size Analysis using Python

This project aims to conduct a comprehensive market size analysis for the Electric Vehicles (EVs) market using Python. 
The analysis will involve gathering relevant data, processing it, and deriving insights to understand the current state 
and potential growth of the EV market.

EV adoption over time

![adoption over time](https://github.com/raman2-dev/EV-Market-Size-Analysis/assets/80435227/f17b5d19-ea8d-4e7a-bae0-9b34ac3771e4)
From the above bar chart, it’s clear that EV adoption has been increasing over time, especially noting a significant 
upward trend starting around 2016. The number of registered vehicles grows modestly up until that point and then rises
more rapidly from 2017 onwards. The year 2023 shows a particularly sharp increase in registered EVs, with the bar for 
2023 is the highest on the graph, indicating a peak in EV adoption.

The top 10 models with the highest average electric range

The TESLA ROADSTER has the highest average electric range among the models listed. TESLA’s models (ROADSTER, MODEL S, MODEL X,
and MODEL 3) occupy the majority of the top positions, indicating that on average, TESLA’s vehicles have higher electric ranges. 
The CHEVROLET BOLT EV is an outlier among the CHEVROLET models, having a substantially higher range than the VOLT and S-10 PICKUP 
from the same maker. NISSAN’s LEAF and CHEVROLET’s SPARK are in the lower half of the chart, suggesting more modest average ranges.
